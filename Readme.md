### Banking App

This is a small banking application which users  
&emsp; 1. Can view cumulative balance  
&emsp; 2. Can view monthly balance

I have followed both Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavioural Driven Development (BDD) <br>
practices for developing the application and have written test cases following both the approaches

**Technolgies Used** <br/>
  * Java 8
  * GIT
  * Maven
  * Junit
  * Cucumber
<br/>
Folllwoing is the program flow to calculate the monthly balance </br>
