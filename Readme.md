### Banking App

This is a small banking application which users  
&emsp; 1. Can view cumulative balance  
&emsp; 2. Can view monthly balance

I developed the application using both test-driven development (TDD) and behavioral-driven development (BDD)  <br>
methodologies and wrote test cases using both approaches, resulting in code coverage greater than 90%.

**Technolgies Used** <br/>
  * Java 8
  * Git
  * GitHub
  * Maven
  * Junit
  * Cucumber
  * Gherkin
  * Mockito
<br/>
Following is the program flow to calculate the monthly balance <br/>
