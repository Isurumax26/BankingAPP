### Banking App

This is a small banking application which users  
&emsp; 1. Can view cumulative balance  
&emsp; 2. Can view monthly balance

I have followed both Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavioural Driven Development (BDD) <br>
practices for developing the application and have written test cases following both the approaches
